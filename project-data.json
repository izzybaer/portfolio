We designed a basic website dedicated to rescuing goats, and connecting people interesting in rescuing goats, across the country. Our site allows people to become a Guardian of the Goats by adding their information and populating it to the page. Others who visit the site are then able to see the current Guardians and contact them directly. The site is also capable of allowing people who know of goats that need help or rescuing to add that goat and all of its information to the site."
